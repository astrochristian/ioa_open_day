# Cosmic Distance Ladder - IoA Open Day 2023

This is the code we used to run the Cosmic Distance Ladder Obstacle Course, an event which was part of the Institute of Astronomy's Open Day for the Cambridge Festival 2023. This was made up of three rounds (representing the three rungs of the cosmic distance ladder) and each participant was scored using the `game.py` python program. The leaderboard is read from `scoreboard.csv` and can be displayed using `leaderboard.py` (requires the `pandas` and `eel` python packages).

All of the participants' scores can be found in `scoreboard.csv` and some basic analysis of the scores is done by `analyse_data.py`.
